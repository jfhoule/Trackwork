The HTML files have been removed and the pages in the `app` directory are now using live data from your Supabase backend. I have also implemented basic functionality for the placeholder pages.

I have also implemented user authentication and a page for creating new projects and editing time entries.

## Next Steps

*   **Forms:** Create forms for editing projects and clients.
*   **Invoices:** Build out the invoice generation and management functionality.
*   **Reports:** Develop the reporting features to provide insights into time tracking data.
*   **Settings:** Implement the user and application settings.
